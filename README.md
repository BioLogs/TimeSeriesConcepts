# Time Series Concepts

This repository is mainly focused on providing *time series* examples, concepts and general
analysis of them in the [Julia programming language](https://www.julialang.org).

It is expected that the reader is familiar with college-level probability and statistics,
multivariable calculus and some numerical methods, namely regression analysis.

All documents are writen in Julia Markdown markup language and converted to HTML files
using [`Weave.jl`](http://github.com/mpastell/Weave.jl).
